# Resume Builder

Small exercise project: a Vite + React app for composing a simple resume with preview panels. Tailwind is used for styling.

How to run

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Dev server: `npm run dev` (open the URL Vite prints)

Notes

- This repo was created as a practice exercise. The components are small and intentionally simple.
- If you want to publish this, run `npm run build` and serve the output.

Files worth checking

- `src/App.jsx` – top-level state and layout
- `src/index.css` – Tailwind directives and small utility classes
- `src/components/` – form and preview components

That's it.
